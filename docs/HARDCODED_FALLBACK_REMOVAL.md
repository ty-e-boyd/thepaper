# Hardcoded Source Fallback Removal

## Summary

Removed all hardcoded fallback logic for RSS feed sources. The application is now **100% database-driven** for both users and sources.

## What Changed

### Before (With Fallbacks)
```go
func GetAllFeeds() []string {
    sources, err := database.GetAllActiveSources()
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("Warning: Failed to get sources from database: %v", err)
        log.Println("Falling back to hardcoded sources")
        return getAllFeedsFromMap()  // ← Fallback
    }
    // ...
}
```

### After (Database-Only)
```go
func GetAllFeeds() []string {
    sources, err := database.GetAllActiveSources()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to get sources from database: %v", err)  // ← Exit
    }
    
    if len(sources) == 0 {
        log.Fatalf("No active sources found in database. Run 'cd scripts && go run seed_sources.go' to populate sources.")  // ← Exit
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **feeds/sources.go**
   - Removed `getAllFeedsFromMap()` function
   - Removed `getCategoriesFromMap()` function
   - Changed warnings to fatal errors in all functions
   - Added check for empty sources with helpful error message

2. **README.md**
   - Updated to emphasize 100% database-driven approach
   - Added note that application will exit if no sources found
   - Clarified FeedSources map is only for seeding

3. **DATABASE_SETUP.md**
   - Added troubleshooting for "No active sources" error
   - Added "100% Database-Driven" section
   - Added first-time setup checklist

4. **COMPLETED_WORK.md**
   - Updated to reflect no-fallback approach
   - Added Phase 3.5 (removal of fallbacks)
   - Updated error handling section

## Behavior Changes

### Application Startup
The application will now **exit immediately** if:

1. **No database connection**
   ```
   Failed to connect to database: connection refused
   ```

2. **No active sources in database**
   ```
   No active sources found in database. 
   Run 'cd scripts && go run seed_sources.go' to populate sources.
   ```

3. **No subscribed users in database**
   ```
   No subscribed users found, exiting
   ```

### Why Fail-Fast?

✅ **Data integrity** - Never send with incomplete data
✅ **Clear errors** - Users know exactly what to fix
✅ **No surprises** - No silent fallbacks to old behavior
✅ **Maintainability** - Less code, clearer logic
✅ **Database-first** - Reinforces database as single source of truth

## FeedSources Map

The `FeedSources` map in `feeds/sources.go` is now **only used for seeding**:

```go
// FeedSources organizes RSS feeds by category (DEPRECATED - kept for seeding)
// Use GetAllFeeds() to pull from database instead
var FeedSources = map[string][]string{
    // ... 81 feeds
}
```

**Purpose:** Reference for `scripts/seed_sources.go` to populate database
**NOT used:** For runtime feed fetching (always pulls from DB)

## Functions Removed

```go
// REMOVED - no longer needed
func getAllFeedsFromMap() []string
func getCategoriesFromMap() []string
```

## Functions Updated

All functions now fail-fast instead of falling back:

```go
GetAllFeeds()         // Exits if DB error or no sources
GetFeedsByCategory()  // Exits if DB error
GetCategories()       // Exits if DB error
```

## Migration Required?

**No migration needed if:**
- You already ran `cd scripts && go run seed_sources.go`
- You have active sources in your database

**Migration needed if:**
- Fresh install → Run seed script before first run
- Database wiped → Re-run seed script

## Testing

```bash
# Build succeeds
go build -o thepaper
✅ Success

# Test without sources (should fail)
# (Delete all sources from DB)
./thepaper
❌ No active sources found in database. Run 'cd scripts && go run seed_sources.go'

# Seed sources
cd scripts && go run seed_sources.go
✅ 81 sources added

# Test with sources (should work)
cd .. && ./thepaper
✅ Found 81 active sources
✅ Application runs normally
```

## Benefits

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Code complexity | Higher (fallback logic) | Lower (fail-fast) |
| Behavior predictability | Unpredictable (silent fallbacks) | Predictable (always DB) |
| Error messages | Generic warnings | Specific, actionable errors |
| Maintenance | Multiple code paths | Single code path |
| Testing | Test both paths | Test one path |
| Data source | Ambiguous (DB or hardcoded?) | Clear (always DB) |

## Error Messages

All error messages are now **actionable**:

```bash
# Before (vague)
"Warning: Failed to get sources from database"
"Falling back to hardcoded sources"

# After (specific with solution)
"Failed to get sources from database: connection refused"
"No active sources found in database. Run 'cd scripts && go run seed_sources.go' to populate sources."
```

## Configuration

No environment variables changed. Still requires:

```bash
DB_CONNECT_STRING=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/thepaper
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
SENDGRID_API_KEY=...
FROM_EMAIL=...
```

## Rollback

If needed, rollback to previous commit:

```bash
git log --oneline | grep "fallback"
git checkout <commit-before-removal>
go build -o thepaper
```

**Not recommended:** Removes clean database-first architecture.

## Summary

The Paper is now **100% database-driven** with no fallbacks:

✅ Users from database (no TO_EMAIL)
✅ Sources from database (no hardcoded fallbacks)
✅ Email tracking in database
✅ Duplicate prevention via database
✅ Fail-fast on missing data

**Result:** Cleaner code, clearer errors, single source of truth.
